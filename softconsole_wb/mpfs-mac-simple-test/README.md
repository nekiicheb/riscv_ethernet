# PolarFire SoC MSS Ethernet MAC Test program - Single MAC, Single Queue 


This program implements a test shell for the PolarFire SoC MSS MAC Ethernet
driver which can be used to exercise the driver on the G5 SoC Emulation Platform
with the Peripheral Daughter Board or the Icicle Kit.

Please note that the sample application assigns a MAC address for the GEM 0 of
00:FC:00:12:34:56 and 00:FC:00:12:34:57 for GEM 1. If you are using multiple 
instances of this software on the same network, you will need to modify 
low_level_init() in e51.c to ensure each GEM device has a unique MAC address.

The following project defines are used to configure the system:

G5_SOC_EMU_USE_GEM0 - Define this to test GEM 0
G5_SOC_EMU_USE_GEM1 - Define this to test GEM 1

TI_PHY - Use G5 SoC Emulation Platform onboard PHY Otherwise VSC8575 PHY is used.

The serial port baud rate is 115200.

To use this project you will need a UART terminal configured as below:

    - 115200 baud
    - 8 data bits
    - 1 stop bit
    - no parity
    - no flow control

The test program responds to the following single key commands via the serial
console:

a - Initiate a PHY autonegotiation cycle on the Ethernet link
A - Initiate a PHY/MAC autonegotiation cycle on the SGMII link
b - Toggle HW Loopback mode. The default is disabled.
B - Toggle broadcast RX mode. The default is to receive broadcasts.
c - Arms the single packet capture feature. A hex dump of the next received
    packet will be displayed via the serial port.
C - Reset the SGMII CDR block
d - Toggle TX Cutthru. The default is disabled.
D - Toggle RX Cutthru. The default is disabled.
e - Display contents of various PHY, MAC and MSS registers for debug purposes
f - Measure and display system clock frequencies
g - Display MSS GPIO 2 input values.
h - Display command help information.
i - Increments the GEM statistics counters using the test feature in the Network
    Control Register.
j - Toggle Jumbo Packet Mode. The default is disabled. If Jumbo packet mode is
    disabled, packets larger than 1536 bytes will not be received.
k - Toggle capture re-trigger mode. The default is disabled. When re-trigger
    mode is enabled, the software will automatically re-enable packet capture
    after displaying a captured packet.
l - Toggles software loopback mode - all received packets are immediately
    re-transmitted. The default is disabled.
L - Toggle SGMII Link Status display mode. When enabled, the display will
    rapidly fill up with repeated + or - characters to show the current link
    status (up or down). The default is disabled.
m - Transmit contents of LIM incrementally, halt if an AMBA error is detected 
M - Transmit contents of LIM incrementally, halt if no AMBA error is detected 
o - Cycle through SGMII TX ODT settings
O - Cycle through SGMII RX ODT settings
n - When in loopback mode, toggles adding of an extra byte(s) to the
    re-transmitted packets. This can be useful when examining Wireshark captures
    as it provides a way of identifying the echoed packets.
p - Toggles promiscuous mode. In promiscuous mode the MAC will receive all
    packets but in normal mode it will only receive broadcast packets and
    packets addressed directly to its MAC address - which defaults to 
    00:FC:00:12:34:56.
P - Step through VSC8662 SGMII loopback modes. None, pad loopback, serial 
    loopback, parallel loopback and non loopback recovered tx clock mode.
q - Enter user mode loopback test.
r - Clears the statistics counts.
s - Displays the GEM statistics, some PHY statistics and some internal software
    generated statistics.
S - Initiate a MAC SGMII autonegotiation cycle.
t - Transmits sample ARP packet.
T - Transmits sample ARP packet with padding that increments after every
    transmit. Packet length varies between 64 and 128 bytes and loops back to 64
    bytes after transmitting a 128 byte packet.
u - Toggle PCS enable bit
U - Toggle SGMII mode enable bit
v - Toggle PCS loopback mode
V - Toggle PCS autonegotiation mode
w - Transmit LIM contents as packets without length field fixup
W - Transmit LIM contents as packets length field fixup
x - Toggles reading of PHY registers. When disabled, the PHY statistics are not
    updated when displaying the statistics. This may help when testing with high
    network loads.
X - Transmit 10 packets in single burst.
y - Transmit LIM as 64 byte packets for 10 minutes using 1000 packet bursts with
    length field fixup.
Y - Transmit LIM as 1518 byte packets for 10 minutes using 1000 packet bursts
    with length field fixup
z - Toggle FCS passthrough mode. When FCS passthrough is enabled, the receive
    packet FCS not checked and is copied to memory. For transmit packets, the 
    GEM assumes the packet already has an FCS and does not append one. The
    default is disabled.
' - Transmit a standard Pause Frame.
, - Transmit a Zero Quantum Pause Frame.
. - Transmit a Priority Based Pause Frame.
+/- Increment/Decrement length adjust. Adjusts the additional length added to
    loopbacked packets when the 'n' command is active.
#/~ Adjust SGMII TX drive strenght up and down
>/< Adjust PHY SGMII TX drive strenght up and down
]/[ Adjust PHY SGMII TX offset up and down
(   Display contents of PHY register as 16 bit hex value. The register number
    is entered as a 4 digit hex number with the first 2 digits representing the
    page number and the second 2 digits representing the register number. 
)   Display current contents of PHY register as 16 bit hex value and then allow
    the user enter a new 4 digit hex value for the register. The register number
    is entered as a 4 digit hex number with the first 2 digits representing the
    page number and the second 2 digits representing the register number. 
2/3/4/5/6/7/8/ select speed mode of Autonegotiate, 10M HDX, 10M FDX, 100M HDX,
               100M FDX, 1000M HDX and 1000M FDX respectively.
                
This test program responds to the above single key commands and will display
responses as appropriate. At any time the list of available commands can be
viewed by pressing'h'. The help display will also show the current settings of
most of the options.

For example, typing the 4 command sequence "spkc" displays the current
statistic information, turns on promiscuous mode, turns on capture auto 
re-trigger mode and enables packet capture so that any received packets are
dumped to the console. This should produce a display something like this:

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Target hardware
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
This example project can be used on PolarFire SoC FPGA family hardware 
platforms.
There are configurations that need to be set for this example project. The
configurations are categorized into hardware and software configurations.
The hardware configurations are located in ./src/boards/<target_board> folder.
The default software configurations are stored under 
.src/platform/platform_config_reference folder.
The include files in the "./src/boards/<target_board>/soc_config" folder define 
the hardware configurations such as clocks. You must make sure that the 
configurations in this example project match the actual configurations of your 
target Libero design that you are using to test this example project.
If you need to change the software configurations, you are advised to create a 
new folder to replicate this folder under the ./src/boards directory and do the 
modifications there. It would look like 
./src/boards/<target_board>/platform_config
The include files in the "platform_config" folder define the software 
configurations such as how many harts are being used in the software, what is 
the tick rate of the internal timer of each hart. These configurations have no 
dependency on the hardware configurations in "soc_config" folder. Note that 
changing these software configurations may require a change in your application 
code.
## Executing project on the PolarFire SoC hardware
This application can be used on PolarFire hardware platform as well e.g. Icicle 
Kit. In this case, the MMUART0 must be connected to a host PC. The host PC must 
connect to the serial port using a terminal emulator such as Tera Term or PuTTY 
or the SoftConsole built-in terminal view.
Build the project and launch the debug configuration named 
"mpfs-mac-simple-test hw all-harts debug" which is configured for 
PolarFire SoC hardware platform.
